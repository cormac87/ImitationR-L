# ImitationR-L

# My University Project, it is a pytorch imitation learning model which uses an expanding horizon to help it imitate the positioning of a player based on the positioning of other players on the field.

# I developed a 3d visualizer in Unity to be able to visualize the results.

# This could be used as a training tool, where you see how a professional player would position in a given position and you can compare it to where you position. Could be used to teach positioning fundamentals.
